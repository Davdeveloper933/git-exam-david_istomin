# Exam
To consolidate your Git knowledge within the company, the final step is to complete the exam assignment.

## Git classic
- Create project repository git-exam-<surname> on your github/bitbucket.
- Make the first commit in master called 'init commit' and containing the file index.php
- Create a 'develop' branch spawned from the master.
- Imagine that there was an error in production that caused the system to malfunction. You need to fix it by calling the phpinfo() function in your index.php file;
- You received the following task to add new functionality to the project. You need to create another file called test.php and add echo 'test'; inside.
- Imagine that you need to release all the functionality.
Представьте, что вам нужно выпустить в релиз весь функционал.
- The repository must contain the changelog.txt file (with the principles of http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), .gitignore, and all branch numbering must be in accordance with the numbering principles.

Please note that all branches: features, hotfixes, releases must be present in origin. It shouldn't be that you did the release/merge, and the branch was only for you locally.
